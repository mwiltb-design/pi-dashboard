# Google Cloud Run Hosting, Storage & Runtime Reference

This document describes the separate hosted Foci deployment. It is not the runtime contract for the native desktop repository. Infrastructure values below were checked against Cloud Run on September 5, 2026; verify them again before making cost, capacity, or security decisions.

---

## 1. Cloud Run Infrastructure & Compute Specs

- **GCP Project ID:** `gen-lang-client-0917427524` (Project Name: `Hackathon`)
- **Service Name:** `foci-dashboard`
- **Region:** `us-central1`
- **Current Resources:**
  - **Memory:** `4Gi` (4 GB RAM)
  - **vCPU:** `2` vCPUs
  - **Scaling:** `min-instances: 0` (scale-to-zero active, $0.00 idle cost), `max-instances: 2`
  - **Timeout:** 3600 seconds (1 hour per request)
- **Runtime Stack:**
  - Node.js `v22.23.2` + Debian Bookworm
  - Python 3.11 pre-configured with geospatial dependencies in `/opt/venv`:
    - `gdal-bin`, `libgdal-dev`, `rasterio`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `shapely`, `geopandas`, `requests`, `geotiff`
    - `/opt/venv/bin` is in the global `PATH`, so standard `python3 ...` and `pip ...` use this environment automatically.

## 2. Persistent Storage Architecture (`/data`)

- **Storage Engine:** Cloud Storage FUSE (GCS bucket `foci-dashboard-data-946747374832` mounted at `/data`).
- **Capacity:** **Virtually unlimited / Petabyte scale**. GCS expands dynamically as needed with no fixed partition limit.
- **Directory Layout:**
  - `/data/projects/<ProjectName>/`: User project workspaces. All files, code, datasets, GeoTIFFs, and HTML reports created here persist across container restarts.
  - `/data/agent/`: Persistent agent state:
    - `/data/agent/MEMORY.md`: Global collaboration memory and user communication preferences.
    - `/data/agent/USER.md`: User profile and identity facts.
    - `/data/agent/dashboard/`: Agent settings and memory checkpoint status counters.
  - `/data/gemini/`: Persistent Gemini OAuth credentials (`oauth_creds.json`), auto-synced with `/home/node/.gemini`.
- **FUSE File System POSIX Shim:**
  - GCS FUSE does not natively support POSIX permissions (`chmod 0600`/`0700`) or atomic socket locks.
  - The container preloads `/usr/local/lib/libfuse-chmod-shim.so` via `/etc/ld.so.preload`.
  - Native `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, SQLite, and atomic file saves work seamlessly inside `/data/projects/`.

## 3. Web App & Vite Previewing on Cloud Run

### A. Static & Client-Side SPAs (Zero Configuration)
- Any HTML file, React/Vue/Vite production build, or Three.js/Leaflet dashboard in the project workspace is served directly via:
  ```
  https://foci-dashboard-xxx.run.app/api/preview/workspace/<path-to-file.html>
  ```
- **How to view:** Select the file from the **📁 HTML File** dropdown in the **App Previewer** tab.

### B. Building a Vite App for Preview on Cloud Run
1. When building a modern frontend app (e.g. React + Vite):
   - Run `npm run build` inside the project folder.
   - Vite outputs the bundled static app into `dist/index.html`.
2. Open the **App Previewer** and select `dist/index.html`.
3. The app renders with full JavaScript, CSS, API calls, and WebGL support.

## 4. Cloud Run Limitations & Plugin Guidelines

1. **Ephemeral Root vs. Persistent `/data`:**
   - Anything saved outside `/data` (e.g. in `/tmp` or `/home/node`) is wiped when the container scales to zero.
   - **Rule:** Always write project code, generated datasets, and persistent artifacts inside the active workspace (`/data/projects/<ProjectName>/`).
2. **Single Public Port (Port 8080):**
   - Google Cloud Run exposes only port `8080` to the internet.
   - Background dev servers listening on arbitrary ports (e.g. `localhost:5173`) cannot be directly accessed over the public internet unless proxied through the main backend or built as static client bundles.
3. **Headless Linux Environment (No Native X11 GUI):**
   - The container runs headless Debian Linux. GUI plugins that require a physical desktop display (like Electron native window popups) do not render.
   - All plugins and interactive dashboards must render as web-based UI components (HTML/CSS/JS) inside the dashboard or previewer iframe.
4. **Scale-to-Zero Latency (Cold Starts):**
   - When the container has been idle for >15 minutes, the next incoming request takes ~3–5 seconds to spin up the container instance before serving traffic.

## 5. Scaling Resources for Large Projects

If a project requires larger compute capacity (e.g. processing massive multi-gigabyte satellite rasters or complex neural model weights), the container can be scaled up using Google Cloud SDK:

```powershell
# Scale to 8 GB RAM / 4 vCPUs
gcloud run services update foci-dashboard `
  --project gen-lang-client-0917427524 `
  --region us-central1 `
  --memory 8Gi `
  --cpu 4

# Scale to 16 GB RAM / 8 vCPUs (High Performance Compute)
gcloud run services update foci-dashboard `
  --project gen-lang-client-0917427524 `
  --region us-central1 `
  --memory 16Gi `
  --cpu 8
```
